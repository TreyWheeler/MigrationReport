(2) Residencia de larga duracion (permanent residence) after roughly five years of legal residence; ongoing right to live and work in Spain with easier renewals and broad equal-rights along with nationals. (3) Residencia de larga duracion de la UE (EU long-term residence) after five years; similar to permanent status but with enhanced cross-EU equal treatment for work, housing and social services. (4) Ciudadania espa\u00F1ola por naturalizacion (Spanish citizenship by naturalization) after long-term residence (often around ten years; shorter in some cases such as marriage to a Spanish citizen or specific nationalities); grants full civil and political rights and a Spanish passport. Other routes exist (student, researcher, etc.) with corresponding residence rights. Action plan for the Valencia family: identify whether family reunification or work-based permits apply, assemble required documents (passports, birth/marriage certificates, antecedentes penales, proof of means, health coverage, housing), apply for visas and residence permits before/after arrival, obtain the TIE within 30 days of arriving, enroll in health care and schools, maintain continuous residency to pursue permanent residency and eventual citizenship if desired.",
