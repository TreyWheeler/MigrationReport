Determination hinges on visa category, sponsorship or family ties, English ability, financial means, absence limits, and security checks. Rights by status: temporary visas provide work access with conditions; ILR/settlement enables permanent residence, NHS access, education, and potential access to public funds under visa rules; citizenship affords full civil rights, voting eligibility, and a UK passport. Action steps: evaluate and pursue the most suitable route for each family member, secure employer sponsorship or family eligibility, prepare and submit required documentation, maintain lawful residence to qualify for ILR (typically around 5 years), then apply for naturalisation when eligible, and stay informed on policy changes that could affect routes or rights.",
