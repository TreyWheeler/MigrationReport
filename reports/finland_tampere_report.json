A TRP allows live-and-work rights for a defined period and may provide access to healthcare; PRP provides ongoing residence with broad work rights and eligibility for social security benefits; citizenship grants full political rights (including voting in national elections) and a Finnish passport. Additional options include the EU Long-Term Residence permit, which can improve mobility within the EU. How statuses are determined: applications go to Migri (Finnish Immigration Service) with evidence of basis (employment or entrepreneurship, family ties, or study), background checks, and integration requirements such as language skills. Rights scale with status: PRP and especially citizenship unlock broader work freedom, social security access, housing and child welfare benefits, and civic rights. Tampere-specific path: begin with a family- or work-based TRP for each member (e.g., join through family ties or pursue a startup/self-employed permit for Trey; Sarah as a family member), ensure valid documentation and health insurance, and register with the Finnish Population Information System. After roughly four or more years of lawful residence and language/integration success, apply for PRP; after additional residence and civic requirements, pursue citizenship. Immediate next steps: document-by-document check for all members (passports, birth certificates, marriage certificates where applicable, proof of funds and income, health insurance), identify the most favorable permit bases for each member, and set a timeline with Migri and Tampere-based services."
