An EU long-term resident status may be available after permanent residence for mobility within the EU. Action steps: begin with a temporary residence permit tied to family status or work, gather documents (US passports for Trey and Sarah, marriage and birth certificates for children, proof of housing and income, health coverage), submit to the appropriate Voivode office, and maintain lawful status and renewals; after meeting residence criteria, apply for permanent residence; pursue citizenship by naturalization if long-term stay and language/ integration requirements are met; explore EU long-term resident options if plans change; consult official government resources or an immigration attorney for current requirements and timelines.",
