Rights by status include: temporary permits allow residence and work; permanent residence expands access to employment without tied programs plus healthcare and social benefits; citizenship adds full civil rights, including voting and a Portuguese passport. Action steps for your Porto family: map your current status path (work, family, or study), maintain continuous residence, begin language and integration efforts, collect required documents, submit applications through SEF and municipal services, and plan for potential naturalization if long-term residency is feasible.
