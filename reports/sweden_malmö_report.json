Rights added: Permanent Residence lets you live and work in Sweden indefinitely, access most social benefits, and pursue family reunification and long-term planning; Citizenship grants full political rights (voting in national/local elections), eligibility for a Swedish passport, and strong protection under Swedish law. Note: temporary residence permits provide more limited rights and require renewal; both statuses typically allow access to universal healthcare and education.
