How determined: by your visa type, total lawful residence years, compliance with conditions (e.g., employment, schooling, absence limits), English language proficiency, and Life in the UK test for naturalisation; typical progression is roughly five years of lawful residence to qualify for ILR, with naturalisation possible after ILR (often after 12 months, or sooner if married to a British citizen). Actionable steps: map out visa pathways (likely Skilled Worker or family visa), maintain clear residence and employment records, plan toward ILR within ~5 years, prepare for English and Life in the UK test, and evaluate citizenship versus long-term settlement based on your family goals; ensure continued access to NHS, schooling for Anduin and Alasdair, and local integration in Guildford.",
