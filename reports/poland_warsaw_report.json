Pathways for your family: pursue family reunification where permitted; transition from temporary to permanent residence as staying time accrues; after long-term residence and integration, consider naturalization. Actions: consult official guidance on gov.pl, assess eligibility for the appropriate status, gather documents (proof of residence, income, health insurance, birth/marriage certificates with necessary apostilles), and engage an accredited immigration professional to submit applications with the appropriate voivodeship offices.
