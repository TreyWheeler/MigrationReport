Gaps: housing costs, childcare affordability, and universal healthcare access remains uneven for migrants. Future resources: expand affordable, family-friendly housing near parks and schools; scale bilingual early childhood education and secular public schooling; strengthen universal healthcare access for migrants; streamline visa/status processes to reduce instability; invest in targeted community health centers and low-latency broadband to support remote work; bolster social inclusion programs to improve safety and civic cohesion. Key metrics to watch: reducing income inequality, improved healthcare access for migrants, educational outcomes for non-native language learners, and crime/safety indicators."
