Permanent residence (residencia permanente) is typically granted after about 5 years of continuous legal residence and allows you to live and work in Spain with access to public healthcare and social services; it does not confer a Spanish passport, but it enables long-term settlement and a smoother path to citizenship. Citizenship by naturalization generally requires about 10 years of legal residence (with shorter timelines for certain groups, including nationals of Ibero-American countries, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, Portugal, and Sephardic origin) and provides full civil rights, eligibility for a Spanish passport, and voting rights. Both routes require an entry or residence permit obtained via the Spanish consulate or local Extranjer\u00EDa offices, proof of income or means, health coverage, and integration steps (language, civic knowledge). Actionable steps for Madrid: choose the appropriate visa track (work/entrepreneur or family reunification); progressively meet the 5-year mark for permanent residence; monitor eligibility and prepare for naturalization if long-term settlement remains the goal; gather required documents (passport, background checks, proof of residency, health insurance); consult official portals or an immigration professional for current forms and processing times."
