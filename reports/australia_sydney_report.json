PR lets you live and work in Australia indefinitely, access Medicare (after applicable waiting periods), and sponsor eligible relatives; it does not confer full voting rights. After meeting residency, character, and English requirements (typically around four years with at least one year as PR), you may apply for citizenship, which grants full political rights (federal and state elections), an Australian passport, and broader eligibility for government roles. Temporary visas exist but offer more limited rights and do not by themselves lead to PR or citizenship. For Sydney, align the family\u2019s tech/remote-work skills with NSW skilled or employer pathways, develop a clear PR plan, gather evidence, and consider engaging a licensed migration professional to pursue PR first and citizenship later.",
