Citizenship is granted by naturalization after a qualifying residence period, language skills, and financial independence. Rights: temporary permits confer lawful stay and work rights for the permit duration; permanent residence enables long-term stay with work rights and broad access to social services; citizenship provides full political rights (vote in national and municipal elections), eligibility for a Finnish passport, and strongest social rights. Action steps for the family: align visa paths with Trey\u0027s work needs, enroll in Finnish language and integration programs to meet language and civic requirements, track residence duration, prepare documentation for permit renewals and eventual naturalization, and consult Migri or an immigration lawyer for timelines and required forms, to secure long-term housing and income to support self-sufficiency."
