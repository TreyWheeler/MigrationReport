Citizenship is the final status with full civil rights, long-term security, and a pathway to visa-free travel and government services. Rights tied to TRP/PR include the ability to live and work legally (often with a separate work permit or employer sponsorship), access to public services and healthcare, schooling for dependents, and eligibility to sponsor relatives; citizenship grants full civil rights, easier travel, and government-service access. Determination is made by the Federal Migration Service / Ministry of Internal Affairs or regional migration authorities based on grounds (employment offer, family ties, education, investment), background checks, financial sufficiency, language and integration criteria, and adherence to residency requirements. Actionable steps for Moscow: consult the Russian consulate in the U.S. or a Moscow-based immigration attorney, assemble required documents (passport, visa history, proof of funds, health and background checks, job offer or family ties), initiate the correct visa route or residence application via gosuslugi/MVD, complete biometrics, and track progression toward PR or citizenship if you plan long-term settlement."
