Long-term EU residence (hossz\u00FA t\u00E1v\u00FA tart\u00F3zkod\u00E1si enged\u00E9ly) is typically available after several years of lawful residence and offers more stable rights and broader work mobility within the EU, subject to ongoing eligibility criteria (income/means, health insurance, housing) and language/integration requirements. Permanent residence (\u00E1lland\u00F3 tart\u00F3zkod\u00E1si enged\u00E9ly) grants indefinite stay with broad rights, including work, healthcare access, social benefits, and easier travel within Hungary/Schengen. Citizenship (\u00E1llampolg\u00E1rs\u00E1g) is typically obtained by naturalization after a prolonged period of lawful residence and demonstration of language proficiency and integration, conferring full political rights and a Hungarian passport. Determination is via application to the Hungarian immigration authorities; criteria commonly include length of residence, lawful status, income/assets, health insurance, housing, a clean criminal record, and, for citizenship, language and civic knowledge. Rights scale with status: temporary rights are limited and tied to the permit; long-term and permanent statuses improve work flexibility and security; citizenship unlocks full political rights and international mobility. Actionable steps for your family: identify the most suitable path (spouse and two children), prepare documents (passport, proof of income/means, health insurance, housing, background checks), maintain lawful residence, apply before expiry, and plan for language integration if pursuing citizenship.",
