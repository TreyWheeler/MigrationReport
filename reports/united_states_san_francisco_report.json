Actions: verify current status with USCIS; ensure passport validity and renew if you are a citizen; keep secure copies of key documents (birth certificate, naturalization certificate or green card, current passport); in San Francisco, use local USCIS resources and district forms; if timelines or forms are unclear, consult an immigration attorney or accredited representative.",
