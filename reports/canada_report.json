Canadian citizen \u2014 obtained by naturalization after meeting required physical presence (typically 3 years in the last 5), language proficiency, knowledge of Canada, and passing a citizenship test and oath; rights include full political rights (vote and run for office), a Canadian passport, and wide mobility rights. Temporary residents \u2014 visitors, students, and workers who hold valid permits/visas; rights are limited to activities permitted by the permit and access to healthcare/social benefits varies by province; maintaining status is essential, and permits must be renewed or visa conditions met or the status risks loss. Pathways and steps to PR from CA include Express Entry (economic), Provincial Nominee Programs, or family sponsorship; required steps generally include document collection (passports, education credentials, work history), language tests, credential assessments, police certificates, medical exams, and timely submission; once PR is obtained, duties include meeting residency obligations and renewing PR cards; citizenship eligibility typically requires several years of PR, language/knowledge requirements, and an oath. Practical plan for your family: evaluate which pathway (economic or family sponsorship) aligns with your timelines, prepare and submit applications, pursue language testing and credential recognition, and map out residency and settlement steps to qualify for citizenship; monitor provincial options and potential sponsorship routes for partners and dependents; stay current with evolving immigration policy and processing times.",
