Citizenship by naturalization requires longer continuous residence and meeting integration criteria (language ability, good conduct, and ties to Taiwanese society); successful naturalization yields ROC citizenship, eligibility for a Taiwan passport, and full political rights. In the meantime, temporary statuses (work permits, student permits, dependent visas) govern duration and specific work/study rights. Actionable next steps: map which pathway fits your timeline (PR vs. potential naturalization), verify eligibility criteria and required documents, begin language and integration steps, and consult official immigration portals or an attorney to stay updated on requirements and processing times, ensuring alignment with your family\u2019s goals (healthcare access, schooling, stability, civil liberties).",
