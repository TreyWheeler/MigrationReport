Citizenship is usually obtained by naturalization after typically 6-8 years of residence (reduced with strong integration or through marriage to a German citizen) and includes full political rights, eligibility for a German passport, and easier family sponsorship. Non-EU family members typically begin with a residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) tied to work or family ties, which can convert to Niederlassungserlaubnis after meeting conditions.
