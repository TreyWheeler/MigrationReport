Rights by status: temporary residents may work only if the visa permits it and generally have restricted access to some benefits; permanent residents may live and work in Brazil indefinitely, access public healthcare and education, and can eventually apply for naturalization; naturalized citizens gain the same rights as native-born Brazilians (including voting and eligibility for most public positions) and can pass nationality to children. Practical steps for your family: identify the most feasible route (family reunification if applicable; work-based permanent residency; or investment/funding routes), start documentation now (passports, birth/marriage certificates, police clearance, health checks, Portuguese readiness), engage a Brazilian consulate or immigration lawyer for a formal check, and plan for Portuguese language learning and integration (housing, schools, healthcare, and work).
