Rights by status: citizens have full work authorization, travel rights, and in-state tuition eligibility where applicable; LPRs have work authorization and a path to naturalization; non-immigrants have status tied to their visa. Gather key documents: passports, birth certificates, marriage certificates, visas, I-94s, and prior approvals; store securely in both digital and physical files. If naturalization (N-400) or adjustment of status (I-485) or family petitions (I-130) are pursued, consult a WA-licensed immigration attorney to tailor steps and timelines to minimize gaps. Apply for filings as needed, monitor status, and keep work authorization active if applicable. In Washington/Seattle, immigration status affects driving license eligibility, in-state tuition, and access to state benefits; coordinate with school/work calendars, renewal reminders, and travel plans to avoid gaps and ensure status aligns with deadlines."
