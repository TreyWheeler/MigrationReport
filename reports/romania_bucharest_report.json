Future resources to close gaps: EU/national funds for bilingual education and childcare subsidies, simplified e-government with multilingual interfaces, credential recognition and job-matching programs, plus startup grants/visa routes to boost migrant entrepreneurship. Practical steps for planners: expand language training for families, offer bilingual schooling options, improve affordable childcare access, and ensure reliable digital access to support remote work and education."
