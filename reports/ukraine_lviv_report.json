Actionable steps for your family: map which status aligns with your timeline and goals (short-term work/family reunification versus long-term residency and eventual citizenship), collect required documents (passports, birth/marriage certificates, proof of housing, employment, or income), apply through the State Migration Service or Ukrainian consulates, monitor processing times and renewals, and plan for children\u0027s education, healthcare access, and earnings accordingly.",
