Rights vary by status: temporary permits enable work access and healthcare; permanent residency enhances mobility, work freedom, and family reunification; citizenship provides full political rights (vote in federal and local elections) and a German passport. Action steps: engage with the local Ausl\u00E4nderbeh\u00F6rde to determine eligibility, gather required documents (proof of income, housing, health insurance, marriage and birth certificates, language certificates), enroll in German language and integration courses, and map a realistic timeline for your family\u2019s path, prioritizing a Blue Card route for Sarah and a plan toward permanent residency and eventual naturalization if desired.",
