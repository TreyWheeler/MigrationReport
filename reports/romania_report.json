Status is determined by the specific visa/permit, length of stay, employment, financial means, and compliance with language and civic integration requirements. Rights attached: temporary permits grant work rights related to the permit and access to core public services; long-term residence broadens work rights, access to healthcare and social benefits, social protections, and eligibility to sponsor family in some cases; citizenship confers full civil and political rights, permanent residency for family, and visa-free travel within the EU. For your family, practical paths include obtaining a work- and family-based temporary permit, then pursuing long-term residence after several years of lawful stay, with language and integration steps, and eventual eligibility for citizenship.
