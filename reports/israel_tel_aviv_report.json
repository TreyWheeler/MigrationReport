Rights typically include lawful residence and work in Israel, access to national health care and most social benefits, and eligibility to apply for citizenship after meeting residence and Hebrew-language criteria; it does not automatically confer national voting rights. Israeli citizenship is primarily obtained through the Law of Return for Jews and eligible family members or through naturalization; acquisition is formalized by the Interior Ministry and, in some cases, by the Population Authority. Benefits of citizenship include full civil rights, eligibility to vote in national elections, a passport, and access to all government services; citizenship can also facilitate family sponsorship and long-term stability, though naturalization often requires a residence period, language ability, and background checks. For your family in Tel Aviv, map your path by assessing eligibility under Law of Return and potential naturalization routes, align timelines with counsel, prepare documentation (birth/marriage certificates, proof of Jewish status or sponsors), and coordinate with employers and healthcare providers to ensure coverage and rights during transition.",
