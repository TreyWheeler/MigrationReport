Citizenship provides full political rights (including voting in most elections) and a Dutch passport. Rights vary by status: temporary permits offer time-limited rights; permanent residents gain long-term residence with broad access to healthcare, education, and social services; naturalized citizens obtain the highest rights, including voting and mobility benefits.
