Category: Daemon Games

    Key: Ease of Entrepreneurship Visa

    Key: Bureaucratic Compliance Effort

    Key: Number of AA Studios
    Guidance: Number of Indie game studios with 10-50 employees

    Key: AAA Studios
    Informational

    Key: Vibrancy of local game development communities

    Key: Feasible Game Grants
    Guidance: For the given city/country and Daemon Games’ profile (small, unfunded indie studio planning a 2-year, ≈1.5M budget, narrative PC/console action-adventure using high-fantasy allegory about resistance to empire and depression, self-publishing on Steam/consoles), identify public support instruments that are realistically attainable within the next 0–3 years: game-specific tax credits, selective prototype/production/marketing grants, innovation or creative-industry funds, and incubator/accelerator programmes that include cash or in-kind financial support. Only consider programmes that accept small or early-stage studios and foreign founders who are willing to incorporate locally, and that are compatible with story-driven premium games without gambling or exploitative monetisation; ignore schemes restricted to gambling, tightly scoped serious/educational games, or projects with budgets far outside the 0.5M–5M range. For each programme, infer basic eligibility (e.g. local spend requirements, cultural tests, minimum team/company age) from up-to-date sources, but treat selection as competitive and focus on whether Daemon should reasonably plan to apply during or shortly before the 2-year development period.
    Value Requirements: Value should be a short, ranked list of 1–5 grant or incentive programmes for that region, each on its own line in the format “ProgramName – ApproxMaxSupport localCurrency (approx USD) – 1-sentence why this is a good fit”; if no realistic programmes exist, return a single line: “None: no realistic grant or incentive programmes identified for this region.” Informational

    Key: Burn Rate
    Guidance: Define yearly base salaries (before employer on-costs) for these roles in the target city/country: Lead Game Designer, Senior Game Developer, Senior VFX Artist, Senior 2D Environment Artist, Senior 3D Character Artist, Senior Character Animator, and Video Game Marketer, plus a yearly office-space cost and a single employerOnCostRate applied to all salaries. Compute yearly burn rate (pre-tax, pre-incentives, pre-revenue) as: yearlyBurn = officeCostPerYear + (sumOfBaseSalariesPerYear × (1 + employerOnCostRate)) + (200_000 / developmentYears). Treat the 200,000 as total fixed marketing/advertising for the whole project, amortised evenly across developmentYears when adding it into the yearly burn.
    Value Requirements: Value should be a single numerical value in local currency rounded to the second decimal. If the local currency isn't the US dollar than it should be converted and appended to the local currency value. Example: €5 ($5.70)

    Key: ROI 400k Units - 2 Years
    Guidance: For the given city/country, estimate yearly base salaries (before employer on-costs) for these roles — Lead Game Designer, Senior Game Developer, Senior VFX Artist, Senior 2D Environment Artist, Senior 3D Character Artist, Senior Character Animator, and Video Game Marketer — plus a yearly office-space cost and a single employerOnCostRate applied to all salaries. Compute devCostBeforeIncentives = developmentYears × (officeCostPerYear + (sumOfBaseSalariesPerYear × (1 + employerOnCostRate))) and devIncentive = devIncentiveRate × devIncentiveEligibleShare × devCostBeforeIncentives, then set adjustedDevCost = devCostBeforeIncentives − devIncentive if the incentive is non-taxable or adjustedDevCost = devCostBeforeIncentives if the incentive is taxable (and in that case you add devIncentive to income instead of subtracting it from cost). Calculate grossRevenue = unitsSold × 20 and netRevenue = grossRevenue × 0.7 (30% platform cut), then profitBeforeTax = netRevenue + (incentiveIsTaxable ? devIncentive : 0) − adjustedDevCost − 200_000 and netProfitAfterTax = profitBeforeTax − max(0, profitBeforeTax × corporateTaxRate). In this case use 2 years and 400k units sold.
