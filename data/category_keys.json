Only consider programmes that accept small or early-stage studios and foreign founders who are willing to incorporate locally, and that are compatible with story-driven premium games without gambling or exploitative monetisation; ignore schemes restricted to gambling, tightly scoped serious/educational games, or projects with budgets far outside the 0.5M–5M range. For each programme, infer basic eligibility (e.g. local spend requirements, cultural tests, minimum team/company age) from up-to-date sources, but treat selection as competitive and focus on whether Daemon should reasonably plan to apply during or shortly before the 2-year development period.",
