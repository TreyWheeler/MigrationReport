Only consider programmes that accept small or early-stage studios and foreign founders who are willing to incorporate locally, and that are compatible with story-driven premium games without gambling or exploitative monetisation; ignore schemes restricted to gambling, tightly scoped serious/educational games, or projects with budgets far outside the 0.5Mâ€“5M range.
