## Executive Summary
- **Top positives**: English-first, stable EU democracy, mild climate, friendly culture, strong tech presence (Dublin), Azure region locally, good nature access.
- **Key concerns**: High housing and childcare costs (esp. Dublin), healthcare wait times, rainy/overcast weather, smaller Ruby and game-dev job markets.
- **Unknowns to research**: Current minimum wage and tax brackets, childcare subsidies in our target cities, game-dev grants timeline and eligibility, processing times for permits.
- **Bottom line (fit for our family)**: Good cultural/political fit and language; quality-of-life balanced by cost and healthcare access. Worth a scouting trip focused on Dublin/Cork/Galway.

## City Shortlist
- Dublin — Deepest tech/game ecosystem; Azure presence; best transit; highest costs.
- Cork — Slower pace, good amenities and schools; growing tech; better affordability than Dublin.
- Galway — Creative vibe, family‑friendly, access to nature; smaller job market; consider remote/hybrid.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Housing scarcity in Dublin — Expand search radius; consider Cork/Galway; engage relocation agents; time move with lease cycle.
- Healthcare wait times — Maintain private insurance; choose area with GP availability; plan for private clinics.
- Childcare cost/availability — Apply early; target neighborhoods with multiple providers; leverage subsidies.

## Open Questions
- What are the current (2025) minimum wage and tax band thresholds?
- Which neighborhoods balance walkability, school ethos (ET/non‑denominational), and rent in each target city?
- Which grants/incubators are most suitable for an indie game studio this year (EI/LEO/New Frontiers timing)?
- What are current processing times and spouse work authorization details for CSEP/GEP?
